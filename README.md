# QuackPlus
**Quack! _(or QuackPlus)_ is an module made for Roblox Studio!**

## Using/Installing/building
**You can use `rojo` to use Quack! in your projects!**

Using _VS Code_ and the _Rojo VS Code extension_, you can build an Roblox map with all the code placed in the correct places/folders.

### Without Rojo
You can copy and paste all file contents (_the `.luau` ones_) into Roblox Studio or import the files using the build-in Studio files importer (not the Bulk one).

## Notes
QuackPlus still in alpha! Please report bugs/glitches or suggest things to me!
