# QuackPlus
Quack! is an Framework made for Roblox Studio!

## Using/Installing/building
You can use `rojo` to use Quack! in you projects!
Using VS Code and the Rojo VS Code extension, you can build an Roblox map with all the code placed in the correct places/folders.

### Without Rojo
You can copy and paste all file contents (the `.luau` ones) into Roblox Studio or import the files using the build-in Studio files importer (not the Bulk one).
